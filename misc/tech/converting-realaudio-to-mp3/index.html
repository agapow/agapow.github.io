      <p>It has been argued that Real Networks and their media player are
deceptive, annoying and inconvenient. If you use an iPod, the last is
certainly true. How do you get RealAudio track playing on your iPod?
Despite some moves by Real towards compatibility, meanwhiles you have to
convert to some useful format like MP3. Unfortunately, getting an audio
converter to understand the Real format can be complicated.</p>
<p>One solution that will work on any platform is to use one of the many
&quot;eavesdropping&quot; applications, that will record the output of another
program, computer or stream: AudioHijack, Wiretap, Streamripper, etc.
Just play the stream and have the converting program listen in and
record. The main problem with this is that it will take the length of
the program to convert it. Otherwise ...</p>
<div class="section" id="windows">
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>This is one of those jobs that is a lot easier under Windows. While a
number of solutions have been suggested, the most straightforward is to
use the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nch.com.au/switch/index.html">Switch music
converter</a>.</p>
<p>But before you do that, so that Switch can understand RealAudio, you
have to install the Real codecs (libraries for interpreting compressed
media) onto your system. The obvious way to do this is to obtain and
install RealPlayer.</p>
<p>Easier said that done. The RealPlayer has a history of being it hard to
find on the Real website (buried behind multiple &quot;opportunities&quot; to buy
the full version of the player). It also has a nasty habit of insisting
on taking over every media file on your system. It's much easier to
find, download and install the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/audiohelp_install.shtml">BBC branded
RealPlayer</a> When
it asks for your name, email and personal details (so you can be sent
&quot;important&quot; announcements and offers) you can just enter bogus details.
When it asks what media types you want it to handle, select the
&quot;Advanced&quot; option and then deselect everything but the actual Real media
formats.</p>
<p>Download and install the Switch converter. Start it up, add the
RealAudio files to the input list. Select MP3 as the output format.
Convert.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="macintosh">
<h2>Macintosh</h2>
<p>There is currently no solution on that Macintosh that works for me.
While an OSX version of Switch is available, it doesn't seem to
recognise Real files regardless of what other applications or codecs are
installed. A slightly complicated solution involving mplayer, a shell
script and free codecs <a class="reference external" href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050130184054216&amp;query=mplayer">has been
proposed</a>,
but I've been unable to make it work, perhaps because library names have
changed since it was written. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040208192926475&amp;query=RealAudio">Music
Safari</a>
(now called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitcartel.com/raw/">iRecord</a>?) looks
promising but isn't fully functional until paid for.</p>
