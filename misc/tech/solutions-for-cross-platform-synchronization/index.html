<h2>The aim</h2>
<p>In a sentence: I want all my project data accessible (readable and
writeable) on every computer.</p>
<p>I'm plagued constantly by wanting <em>that</em> dataset that's on <em>that</em> computer
over there, being unable to tell if I've got the latest version of a
manuscript in front of me, having to refer back to earlier versions to
justify some analysis and finding out I did that work on that other
machine ...</p>
<p>Some of these problems are mitigated by using cloud services (e.g.
Gmail, Mendeley), distributed version control (e.g. git) and
transferring files around (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive). But the issue
isn't broadly solved and I keep discovering that I need files and data
that are somewhere else. This is complicated by the fact that I work in
a heterogeneous environment. I'd prefer to do most work under Linux or
unix-like environments, there's the home Mac, workplaces often insist
that I use Windows, I have an Android tablet ...</p>
<p>Quotes below are from various forums and people I asked for their
experiences.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-parameters">
<h2>The parameters</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Reliability: it's no good if 99% of files sync 99% of the time</li>
<li>No babysitting: a solution that takes care of itself and doesn't need constant attention (or any attention) is preferred</li>
<li>Cost: self-obvious</li>
<li>Security: I've got no personal information on there, but there's no need to be cavalier</li>
<li>Space: probably only a small amount of storage will be needed at first (i.e. a few gig) but this is certain to grow</li>
<li>All files and all info: solutions that exclude files or transform them are right out</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="suggested-solutions">
<h2>Suggested solutions</h2>
<div class="section" id="google-drive">
<h3>Google Drive</h3>
<p>I use Google for a lot of stuff (email etc.) so it seems natural to look
at Google Drive. It's very secure, the extra storage is cheap enough,
but I've found it incredibly unreliable: Some files just refuse to sync
or take ages to appear, seemingly without rhyme or reason. Broadly, the
sync seems to be a bit stupid. On Ubuntu there's no native client, but
Insync uses your Google space and seems to work well - although there
are also a few reports of it not syncing or excluding files. Google's
web UI isn't entirely to my liking either - it insists on treating
everything as sorted by keywords / tags and so deep folder hierarchies
are turned into a flat mess.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> secure, cheap storage, compatibility with other Google
services, web interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> no native Linux client, unreliable sync, weird web interface</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dropbox">
<h3>Dropbox</h3>
<p>I've used Dropbox for years: it's reliable and &quot;just works&quot;. The Linux
client is good. (The Android client less so, but it's improving.) But
extra space isn't cheap and their patchy record on security gives me
pause.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> just works, web interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive extra storage, dodgy security</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sparkleshare">
<h3>SparkleShare</h3>
<p>A git-based system for syncing and revising your work. While this seems
like a great idea - and does work well for small stuff - size and
performance starts to suffer with larger data, especially binaries. This
is apparently being looked at but there is no timetable for a fix.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> it's git! And we can get git everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> problems with binaries and large files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="owncloud">
<h3>OwnCloud</h3>
<p>A self-hosted solution that needs a full LAMP stack on the server,
although that provides a nice web interface. There are mixed reports on
this one - some claimed that the software was slow and crashy on both
the client and server ends. Others said they'd &quot;had no problems&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> web interface, self hosted so you can have as much space as
you want</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> self-hosted so you have to keep it running and working,
reliability</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spideroak">
<h3>SpiderOak</h3>
<p>SpiderOak is basically a far more configurable Dropbox: you can point at
individual folders on individual machines and get them backed up into
the cloud, then linking any of those folders to the others be
synchronized. There's a web interface, a handy &quot;share this folder on the
web&quot; feature, a new &quot;Hive&quot; feature that basically duplicates Dropbox.
Also the whole thing is ridiculously secure, with all the data being
encrypted in transmission and storage, to the point that SpiderOak HQ
says if you lose your password, they are unable to help you. On the down
side, when a new folder or machine is introduced, it seems to be very
slow to propagate.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> security, does everything Dropbox does, configurability,
Android client</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> extra storage is not cheap, client may be slow</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="others">
<h3>Others</h3>
<p>There's a bewildering array of solutions for this, so many that a lot
had to be dismissed for fairly minor reasons (small user base, a lot of
software installation, &quot;techy&quot;, etc.). Solutions not examined in depth
include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Seafile</li>
<li>Roll my own manual solution using rsync: charming but I'd have to trigger it myself (although a cron job could be written) and I've got enough else to do.</li>
<li>Jungle Disk: reported to have a slow client and dodgy synchronization</li>
<li>Syncany: not ready and by one report &quot;probably never will be&quot;</li>
<li>Box.net: no official Linux client &quot;but if you have root and can install WebDAV you should be able to make it work&quot;. Urgh, no.</li>
<li>Bittorrent Sync</li>
<li>Wuala</li>
<li>SugarSync</li>
<li>Box</li>
<li>Bitcasa</li>
<li>SkyDrive</li>
<li>Tresorit</li>
<li>Syncplicity</li>
<li>Apple iCloud</li>
<li>git-annex assistant</li>
<li>Sparkleshare</li>
<li>Tahoe-LAFS</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I went with SpiderOak. US$10 a month gives me 100G and after 3 months it
seems to be working fine. True, the initial upload and sync was sluggish
(a few days for 10G) but this may have been effected by a poor internet
connection here. The ability to configure it for multiple folders has
proven to be surprisingly handy - I sync up my project folder, ebooks
folder and image folder. (The music will be next.) And it needs no
attention and just does its job in the background.</p>
<p>Having said that, Dropbox will be a fine solution for most people.
Certainly the storage is expensive, but if you've only got a little data
and are a bit canny with their referrals bonuses, it should be enough.
It's inflexible being a single folder, but again that will suit a lot of
people. Most of all, it just works.</p>
