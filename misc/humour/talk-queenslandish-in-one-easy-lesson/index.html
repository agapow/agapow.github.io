		<div class="summary">A brief guide to the curious linguistics of north-eastern Australia.</div>


      <p>I had the dubious pleasure of growing up in Queensland, a sun-soaked and
slightly backwards part of Australia., second only to South Australia
for its obscurity <a class="reference external" href="talk-queenslandish.html#ref1">[1]</a>. However, over the years I've come to remember
Queensland speech with some affection, a dialect in which it is possible
to have an hour long conversation that consists of a dozen repeated
mono-syllabic grunts and not a single hard consonant. Indeed, if the
world was to adopt the Queensland tongue, Ludwig Zamenhof's <a class="reference external" href="talk-queenslandish.html#ref2">[2]</a> dream
would be fulfilled and we could all live in harmony, the only arguments
being those over exactly how &quot;bloody hot&quot; it is and whose turn it is to
get the beer.</p>
<p>While some of the Australian slang dictionaries list regional slang,
they seem to be mostly the product of someone with an overly active
imagination. To this end, I present this brief introduction to the
speech patterns and vocabulary of Queensland. A warning: visitors to
Queensland should not attempt to use this slang or to imitate the
accent, as being called &quot;a wanker&quot; may offend.</p>
<div class="section" id="general-principles">
<h2>General principles</h2>
<div class="section" id="the-accent">
<h3>The accent</h3>
<p>Broadly speaking, Queenslanders follow the rural Australian accent,
which is slow and twangy. However, Queenslanders' voices are less harsh,
being softer, breathier and flatter. (This may make it sound quite
attractive. Be disabused of this notion immediately.) The sound can be
approximated by speaking through your nose and one side of your mouth,
while squinting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-ubiquitous-mono-syllable">
<h3>The ubiquitous mono-syllable</h3>
<p>Why use ten words when clearing your throat will do just as well?
Queenslanders have large and subtle repertoire of mono-syllables and
grunts they can deploy as conversational shorthand. For instance:</p>
<div class="section" id="a-rising-ey-at-the-end-of-a-sentence">
<h4>A rising &quot;ey?&quot; at the end of a sentence</h4>
<p>As with many Canadians, Queenslanders have the habit of tacking a
querulous &quot;ey?&quot; on the end of every sentence, which translates as <em>This
thing that I have just said, is it not most worthy and correct? If you
do not say otherwise, I shall assume so!</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-protracted-arhhh-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence">
<h4>A protracted &quot;arhhh ...&quot; at the beginning of a sentence</h4>
<p>A piratical device beloved of former Australian Prime Minister Bob
Hawke, this roughly means: <em>I have something of the greatest importance
to say. However, as I have not yet figured out what it exactly is, this
extended groan will serve as a placeholder for the time being.</em> Thus, it
is impolite to interrupt someone &quot;mid-arhhh&quot;, for they have already
started talking, even if their speech is as yet devoid of nouns, verbs,
a subject, any objects, or in fact any words at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-extended-rising-falling-ohhhhh-as-a-response">
<h4>An extended rising &amp; falling &quot;ohhhhh!&quot; as a response</h4>
<p>Hearing this peppered through conversations, an outsider might surmise
that Queenslanders are in a perpetual state of faint surprise at
everything. In reality, this has a looser meaning along the lines:
<em>Although I am tongue-tied, what you say is interesting, and you should
continue, for I have nothing to contribute at this point.</em> For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The spare key is in the kitchen drawer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ohhhhh!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And saurian-like aliens have invaded our planet, dooming us to
life-long imprisonment in their vast subterranean meat-factories,
where our children will grow up as stunted albinos, having never
seen the sun.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ohhhhh!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-sibilant-duo-syllable">
<h4>The sibilant duo-syllable</h4>
<p>While it's an Australia-wide habit to abbreviate words, Queenslanders
excel in this practice, hacking any words longer than two syllables down
to just one and then tacking on a random vowel. Actually words of one
syllables are often lengthened to two, and those with two syllables
mutated to match this pattern. Hence, at the University
of Queensland, engineering students were called &quot;engies&quot;, journalism
students &quot;journos&quot;, music students &quot;musos&quot; and pharmacy students
&quot;pharmos&quot;. Personal names are often composed in the same way: &quot;Gazza&quot;,
&quot;Warny&quot;, &quot;Poida&quot;. Also see <em>postie</em>, <em>Brizzie</em>, <em>rego</em>, <em>truckie</em>,
<em>Gabba</em>, <em>rellies</em> and many, many others.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rhyming-slang">
<h3>Rhyming slang</h3>
<p>For some reason, many Australian vocabulary guides have long lists of
opaque rhyming slang. No one ever, ever speaks like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="obsolete-slang">
<h3>Obsolete slang</h3>
<p>Due to old movies and the actions of over-enthusiastic and sentimental
natives, there is a whole list of supposed slang that hasn't actually
been used in the last 50 years. For example: &quot;bonza&quot;, &quot;cobber&quot;,
&quot;corker&quot;, &quot;sheila&quot;, &quot;strewth&quot;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-words">
<h2>The Words</h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This list is very much in progress. Also, many of the words are not restricted to Queensland, but are favourites of the natives. Thus I've included them. Any contributions are welcome.</p>
</div>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>aerial ping pong</dt>
<dd>Australian rules football. In the UK and most of the world,
&quot;football&quot; usually means soccer. In the USA, it means gridiron.
In Queensland, it means rugby. By contrast, in Victoria
(the south), it means &quot;Australian rules&quot;, a mobile and quick game
with some resemblance to Gaelic football, although no one is really
sure where it came from. In any event, Queenslanders regard Aussie
rules as an effete abomination of their own rugged and violent
sport.</dd>
<dt>Asian</dt>
<dd>In Australia, this means &quot;from south-east Asia&quot; - China, Japan,
Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia etc. etc. In the UK, &quot;Asian&quot; refers to
the Indian subcontinent - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh - whom
Australians blithely group together as &quot;Indians&quot;, which I'm told is roughly
congruent with the US meaning.</dd>
<dt>banana bender</dt>
<dd>Someone from Queensland. Note that Queenslanders never use this word
themselves. Never ever ever.</dd>
<dt>bastard</dt>
<dd>Not necessarily a bad word, often used for comic or dramatic effect
as in &quot;you bastard&quot;, &quot;dumb bastard&quot; or &quot;who was the stupid bastard
that suggested that?&quot;. The word &quot;mongrel&quot; has a similar usage.</dd>
<dt>beer</dt>
<dd>In Australia, &quot;beer&quot; always, always means &quot;lager&quot;.</dd>
<dt>blue</dt>
<dd>Used to mean (1) an argument or quarrel, or (2) the default nickname
for someone who has fair skin and red hair, or (3) a type of cattle dog (blue heelers). In a few centuries, Queensland
vocabulary will probably consist solely of this word and a series of
surprised grunts.</dd>
<dt>bonus</dt>
<dd>An exclamation of surprise and delight.&quot;I won the casket! Bonus!&quot;</dd>
<dt>bottle shop</dt>
<dd>What you durn foreigners would call a liquor store or off-license.</dd>
<dt>bevan</dt>
<dd>Derogatory term for someone working class or from the wrong side of
town. You could argue it's to do with them being uneducated and
working class, but it's really more to do with them wearing <em>ugg
boots</em> and flannel shirts, driving panel vans and listening to heavy
rock. You know a bevan when you see one. Known in Melbourne as
&quot;bogans&quot; and Sydney as &quot;westies&quot;.</dd>
<dt>big smoke</dt>
<dd>The big city.</dd>
<dt>bilby</dt>
<dd><em>Macrotis lagotis</em> or the rabbit-eared bandicoot. Looking like a
cross between a mouse and a minute kangaroo, this cute little fellow
lives in the arid deserts of Australia. In recent years it's been
adopted as an indigenous replacement for the Easter Bunny - rabbits
being a major pest in Australia - and shops have started selling
chocolate bilbies. Unfortunately, the bilby population is slowly
dying out. There's something peculiarly Australian about replacing a
traditional fertility symbol with an animal that has trouble
reproducing.</dd>
<dt>bloke</dt>
<dd>A man, used in the same sense as &quot;guy&quot; or &quot;fella&quot;. As in: &quot;Who
called earlier?&quot; &quot;I dunno, some bloke.&quot;</dd>
<dt>bludger</dt>
<dd>Someone lazy. Usually used in the sense of unemployment, as per the
radio shock-jock's favourite phrase &quot;dole bludger&quot;. Can also be used
as a noun (&quot;having a bludge&quot;) or verb (&quot;can I bludge off you?&quot;).</dd>
<dt>bodum</dt>
<dd>Universal word for cafetieres or french press coffee makers, and a
glowing tribute to the dedication of the marketing division of the
Bodum kettle company.</dd>
<dt>Brisbane</dt>
<dd>Pronounced <em>BRIZbin</em>. The capital of Queensland. Also called
&quot;Brizzie&quot;.</dd>
<dt>Brisvegas</dt>
<dd>A recent name for Brisbane, not always used ironically. Its origin
is obscure, but probably refers to Brisbane's efforts to turn itself
from a sleepy regional centre into a bustling international
metropolis.</dd>
<dt>Bundy and coke</dt>
<dd>Relatively cheap and toxic drink made from coke and Bundaberg rum,
and the cause of at least one embarrassing alcoholic moment for
nearly everyone who has grown up in Queensland. Australians
travelling overseas are stunned by the fact that Bundaberg rum is
marketed globally, just like a name brand that people might
deliberately seek out. Given that it tastes like a low quality
diesel fraction, this is deeply mysterious.</dd>
<dt>bush pig</dt>
<dd>Someone ugly. While bush pigs are certainly not attractive, why they
get singled out for this backhanded abuse is unclear.</dd>
<dt>cacking</dt>
<dd>Not to be confusing with the English meaning, this means roughly &quot;to
laugh so hard as to soil yourself&quot;. As in: &quot;When Tanya backed her
ute into the mailbox, I was cacking myself.&quot;</dd>
<dt>casket</dt>
<dd>The Golden Casket, Queensland's version of the lottery, and
used colloquially in the same sense: &quot;One day when I win the casket
...&quot; One of those words that you don't notice until leaving the
state and then wondering if a lottery was really marketed like some
pirates chest overflowing with dubloons.</dd>
<dt>chemist</dt>
<dd>A pharmacist or pharmacy.</dd>
<dt>cockie</dt>
<dd>A cockroach. Also a cockatoo. Also, a New South Wales word for
farmer. Curiously, all are present in large quantities in
Queensland.</dd>
<dt>cockroach</dt>
<dd>Charmingly, someone from New South Wales. Also known as &quot;Mexicans&quot;
(as in &quot;south of the border&quot;).</dd>
<dt>college</dt>
<dd>One of a set of internationally confusing terms. In Queensland,
&quot;school&quot; means &quot;school&quot; as in the first 12 years of basic compulsory
education. However, some of the posher schools (and you don't have
to be very posh to be posh in Queensland) call themselves
&quot;colleges&quot;, while others use the term &quot;secondary college&quot; to
differentiate years 8 to 12. After school, one can on to tertiary
education at a university, or a &quot;college&quot;, which is usually a small
university campus or institute that does vocational training (what
was once called a &quot;polytechnic&quot; in the UK). Also used to describe the
residential halls at major universities. So you can go to college at
a college and when you finish, you move on to college where you stay
at a college.</dd>
<dt>crash</dt>
<dd>To collapse from exhaustion. Often used as a sign of just how hard
you were partying last night.</dd>
<dt>CWA</dt>
<dd>Country Womens Association. Loosely like a paleo-conservative and
rural version of the YWCA, this is where all the country girls go to
stay initially when they move down to the <em>big smoke</em>.</dd>
<dt>dag</dt>
<dd>Somewhat like &quot;nerd&quot; or &quot;geek&quot;, but more a comment about a lack of
sophistication which makes it closer to &quot;yokel&quot;. Of course, making
this accusation in Queensland is absurd at the best of times ...</dd>
<dt>digger</dt>
<dd>As in &quot;old digger&quot;. Strictly speaking, this only applies to
Australian veterans of WWI, but can be used generically to describe
any old <em>bloke</em>, especially a curmudgeon that glares at you when you
enter &quot;his&quot; pub and later assails you endlessly with stories of how
he saved you from the Hun at El Alamein.</dd>
<dt>doona</dt>
<dd>A duvet, comforter or quilted eiderdown used as a bed covering.</dd>
<dt>deep north</dt>
<dd>An allusion to the American &quot;deep south&quot;, used by non-Queenslanders
to refer to (supposedly) fundamentalist, racist, Bible-bashing,
inbred Queensland. Curiously, it's since been used by those in
southern Queensland to refer to far north Queensland, with somewhat
more justification.</dd>
<dt>durrie</dt>
<dd>A cigarette, particularly a hand-rolled one.</dd>
<dt>footy</dt>
<dd>Sibilant duo-syllable for &quot;football&quot;, thus shortening a word with
two syllables to one with two syllables ...</dd>
<dt>fossick</dt>
<dd>To rummage around or search for something. While this is usually
applied in the domestic context, it can be used for hunting for gems
or mineral deposits.</dd>
<dt>furphy</dt>
<dd>A lie or tall story.</dd>
<dt>Gabba</dt>
<dd>The Queensland Cricket Ground at Woolloongabba. During summers it
becomes the most highly televised and observed place in the state.</dd>
<dt>gone troppo</dt>
<dd>Gone mad (because of the heat) or moved to a hot place (where they
will go mad because of the heat).</dd>
<dt>go walkabout</dt>
<dd>A strangely cliched but genuine bit of slang, meaning &quot;to get lost&quot;
or &quot;or wander off&quot;. So your car keys could &quot;go walkabout&quot; and when
someone fails to show up for a meeting, they're &quot;gone walkabout&quot;.</dd>
<dt>hole in the wall</dt>
<dd>A cash machine or automated teller. I could make some comment about
how this reflects a cargo-cult mentality towards banks and money.
But I won't.</dd>
<dt>hols</dt>
<dd>Holidays.</dd>
<dt>hotel</dt>
<dd>A pub, as in a place where you would drink. Also sometimes actually
means &quot;hotel&quot;.</dd>
<dt>hit the turps</dt>
<dd>To go on a drinking binge. Of course, &quot;turps&quot; (via &quot;turpentine&quot;)
means &quot;alcohol&quot;.</dd>
<dt>huge</dt>
<dd>A vague but enthusiastic positive comment, much like &quot;excellent&quot; or
&quot;massive&quot;. As in: &quot;How was the party?&quot; &quot;Mate, it was huge.&quot;</dd>
<dt>humougous</dt>
<dd>A similar meaning to <em>huge</em>. Sometimes, it even means &quot;big&quot;.</dd>
<dt>hunt</dt>
<dd>Possibly archaic, but used as an exclamation of how great something
is. As in: &quot;I brought two slabs of beer&quot; &quot;Hunt!&quot;. The antonym is
&quot;unhunt&quot;. I was told this word derives from &quot;hunt out a bargain&quot;,
which seems just as likely as any other possibility.</dd>
<dt>krull</dt>
<dd>Possibly archaic or of restricted usage, for a while in the early
90s this meant &quot;to destroy utterly&quot;. Probably derived from a very
forgettable movie.</dd>
<dt>lamington</dt>
<dd>A small square of sponge cake covered in chocolate and desiccated
coconut. A true Queensland icon, as schools often raise money by
having &quot;lamington drives&quot; in which parents make large amounts of
lamingtons for school-children to hawk door-to-door. That the
education of the next generation in &quot;The Smart State&quot; depends in a
large part on these sales of sponge cake is an irony that has
apparently missed the populace.</dd>
<dt>mate</dt>
<dd>Variously, &quot;you there&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;companion&quot;, as in &quot;Hey mate&quot;
<em>Excuse me, may I have your attention?</em>, &quot;Thanks mate&quot; <em>Thank you,
my friend</em>, &quot;Well, you and your mates can just piss off&quot; <em>Your
entourage is no longer welcome in this establishment</em>, and &quot;Who's
his mate?&quot; <em>What is the identity of the person standing next to
him?</em>. Note that <em>mate</em> is a gender neutral term.</dd>
<dt>mozzie</dt>
<dd>Mosquito. That damn <em>sibilant duo-syllable</em> again.</dd>
<dt>milkbar</dt>
<dd>What might be called a &quot;deli&quot; in New York or a &quot;cornershop&quot; in
London, a small local store that contains one copy of every object
in the known world that you only buy for an inflated price because
it's just too far to the supermarket.</dd>
<dt>moggy</dt>
<dd>A cat, especially a plain-old, domestic, no-particular-breed-at-all
cat. I can't believe you didn't know that.</dd>
<dt>New Australians</dt>
<dd>One of an endless line of official euphemisms for immigrants that immediately fell into common satirical usage. See also <em>ethnic</em>.</dd>
<dt>no drama</dt>
<dd>&quot;No problem&quot;. Also used as &quot;no worries&quot;, &quot;zero sweat&quot;.</dd>
<dt>Paki</dt>
<dd>Some one from Pakistan. Oddly enough, in England this is an
incredibly loaded racial epithet, but in Australia it's just a way
of describing nationality, modified into a sibilant duo-syllable -
just like &quot;Kiwi&quot;, &quot;Pommie&quot; &quot;Yankee&quot; and <em>Windies</em> - and has no
negative connotations at all. In summer the ads for the cricket cry
out &quot;The Pakis are coming!&quot;, which must cause English migrants to
have a fit. Also see <em>Asian</em>.</dd>
<dt>packing it</dt>
<dd>Roughly analogous to &quot;shaking in their boots&quot; or &quot;trembling with
fear&quot;, but used for comic or dramatic effect. &quot;Mate, when Davo saw
the the cops in his rear vision mirror, we were just packin' it.&quot;
Also used as &quot;packing&quot;, and &quot;packing her/himself&quot;.</dd>
<dt>pike</dt>
<dd>To make a flimsy excuse to get out of something. &quot;Did Gazza show up
to the party?&quot; &quot;Nah, he piked. Said he had to drive the girlfriend
to work.&quot;</dd>
<dt>pissed</dt>
<dd>Can be used in the American (&quot;angry&quot;), English (&quot;drunk&quot;), anatomical
(&quot;urinated&quot;), meteorological (&quot;rained a lot&quot;) or movement (&quot;ran
away&quot;) sense. As in: &quot;Davo was so pissed that it was pissing down,
he got pissed and pissed himself so we pissed off.&quot; As is often the
case in Australian speech, context is everything.</dd>
<dt>port</dt>
<dd>Bag, suitcase or satchel, especially one used for school. Probably
derived from the English word &quot;portmanteau&quot;. Endlessly confusing to
the rest of the Australia, where for many years &quot;port&quot; referred to a
popular style of fortified red wine, originally from Portugal.</dd>
<dt>Queenslander</dt>
<dd>What people from Queensland call themselves, but also a local style
of house. It is built on stumps (and thus raised off the ground)
with wide verandas and a tin roof, and is gloriously suited to the
local climate.</dd>
<dt>x's right</dt>
<dd>From experience, this is the construct that causes the greatest
amount of confusion in non-Queenslanders. It occurs variously as
&quot;It's right&quot;, &quot;You're right&quot;, &quot;She's right&quot; (but never &quot;He's right&quot;)
and means in answer to an offer of assistance  <em>It's fine / don't
worry / don't bother / it's okay</em>. Note how it conveniently
reduces a lengthy two word phrase to a terse two word phrase.</dd>
<dt>rego</dt>
<dd>Car registration or tax disk . Because &quot;registration&quot; has, like,
four syllables in it ...</dd>
<dt>rellies</dt>
<dd>Relatives. As in: &quot;I have to go and visit the rellies.&quot;</dd>
<dt>rooted</dt>
<dd>Irrevocably broken. As in: &quot;Your hard disk is rooted mate. Need to
get a new one.&quot; &quot;Root&quot; also means &quot;to have sex&quot;.</dd>
<dt>scallop</dt>
<dd>A battered potato cake (&quot;potato scallop&quot;) such as you'd buy in a
fish and chip shop. Also - confusingly - the battered fish
(<em>Patinopecten sp.</em>), also as you'd buy in a fish and chip shop.
Queenslanders use the same word to refer to both, instinctively
recognising from context which meaning is the intended one. For
example: &quot;I'd like 4 dollars worth of chips and a couple of
scallops.&quot; &quot;OK. Anything else?&quot; &quot;Ah ... throw in a few scallops as
well.&quot; &quot;Coming right up.&quot; This turns out to be a similar usage form
the North of England.</dd>
<dt>Schoolies</dt>
<dd>The &quot;Schoolies' Week&quot;, an end-of-year week-long party held down the
Gold Coast by those graduating from school. Also attracts a large
number of predatory or infantalised university students.</dd>
<dt>scratchie</dt>
<dd>A scratchcard, with slivery panels that you rub off, such as used in
the lottery or on public transport.</dd>
<dt>she</dt>
<dd>Commonly used instead of &quot;it&quot;, as in &quot;She's hot outside today&quot;, &quot;She's broken&quot;, etc. I don't think this is misogynist in any way, just odd.</dd>
<dt>slab</dt>
<dd>A measurement of amount of beer, specifically 24 <em>tinnies</em> or
<em>stubbies</em> on a cardboard pallete. If it's a box of large bottles of
beer, it's called a &quot;carton&quot;. This is what people bring to parties.
Reputedly, some <em>truckies</em> measure the length of their trips in
slabs or cartons. If you're driving on Queensland roads, this is
probably something you didn't want to know.</dd>
<dt>spewing</dt>
<dd>Expressing comical disappointment or regret. &quot;Mate, when I found out
that Lorraine had actually wanted to go out with me, I was spewing.&quot;
Also used in the sense &quot;to vomit&quot;. Go figure.</dd>
<dt>spruik</dt>
<dd>A word I used for years before finding no one else knew what it was.
To spruik is to promote, advertise, proselytise, argue for but with
the faint connotation of the carnival barker than of an honest
argument. Can also be used as a noun to describe the product or
output of said spruiking.</dd>
<dt>skeg</dt>
<dd>A surfie.</dd>
<dt>station</dt>
<dd>One of the immense farming properties you'll find in the outback.
Sometimes just called a &quot;property&quot;, never a &quot;ranch&quot; or &quot;farm&quot;.</dd>
<dt>squizz</dt>
<dd>A quick look, an assessment, a once over. Used as both noun and
verb. &quot;Let me have a squizz at that.&quot; Interestingly this appears to
be an old bit of English slang, derived from &quot;inquire&quot; and
&quot;inquisitive&quot;.</dd>
<dt>semi</dt>
<dd>Semi-trailer or articulated lorry to you Poms. This is what
Queenslanders mean by truck.</dd>
<dt>stubby</dt>
<dd>A small bottle (about 500ml) of beer. See <em>tinny</em>. &quot;Stubbies&quot; are
also a popular brand of shorts.</dd>
<dt>sunnies</dt>
<dd>Sunglasses.</dd>
<dt>suss</dt>
<dd>Derived generally from &quot;suspicious&quot; but again, used as an adjective
and a verb, with two different meanings. &quot;Seems a bit suss&quot; <em>(this
item is anomalous, nay untrustworthy</em>) or &quot;I sussed out a good deal&quot;
(<em>using my raw cunning, I was able to derive a solution</em>).</dd>
<dt>ta</dt>
<dd>Thank you.</dd>
<dt>thongs</dt>
<dd>Rubber sandals, what someone from the UK might call &quot;flip-flops&quot; or
&quot;jandals&quot; in New Zealand. Essential for the beach, everyone owns a
pair of these.</dd>
<dt>this arvo</dt>
<dd>This afternoon, pronounced as one word <em>thiSARvo</em>.</dd>
<dt>tinny</dt>
<dd>A tin (can) or beer. See <em>stubby</em>.</dd>
<dt>togs</dt>
<dd>Bathers or swimsuit. Sydney-siders say &quot;cossie&quot;, which is anathema
to Queenslanders.</dd>
<dt>truckie</dt>
<dd>A truck driver, but when I say truck, I mean <em>semi</em>.</dd>
<dt>u-ee</dt>
<dd>A U-turn in a car. &quot;So I did a u-ee ...&quot;</dd>
<dt>ugg boats</dt>
<dd>Uggies, thick sheepskin boots that are universally loved by
<em>bevans</em>, inexplicably so, given Queensland's tropical climate.</dd>
<dt>ute</dt>
<dd>Small utility truck.</dd>
<dt>whinging Pom</dt>
<dd>The archetype of the English in Australia, who seem to spend their
whole time complaining about the weather, delays in public transport
and poor service in restaurants. Like many stereotypes there is a
small vein of truth, although in their defence, I can attest to the
presence in London of thousands of &quot;whinging Aussies&quot;.</dd>
<dt>Windies</dt>
<dd>Someone from the West Indies, and almost always someone from their
cricket team.</dd>
<dt>wog</dt>
<dd>Someone of Greek or Italian extraction, and sometimes anywhere
non-Anglo-saxon as long as you have a swarthy complexion. One of
those complicated words that used to be derogatory (as it still is
in England) but was later reclaimed by young Greek- and
Italian-Australians, and has so become almost respectable. Almost.
Wogs can call each other wogs but don't <em>you</em> try to. Has an implied
image of brashness, loudness, trashy pop-culture, big hair and
muscle cars.</dd>
<dt>wowser</dt>
<dd>A prude or conservative, stereotypically reactionary, anti-alcohol,
anti-sex and luddite. According to the rest of Australia, Queensland
is full of them. This fails to explain the brisk tourist trade.</dd>
<dt>XXXX</dt>
<dd>The chosen beer of the sunshine state, a golden ambrosia compared to
the filthy slop that passes for <em>beer</em> in other states.</dd>
<dt>yum cha</dt>
<dd>Confusing this one. A near universal word used to describe the meals
bought from trolleys in Chinese restaurants. From observation, this
isn't what the Chinese call it, and elsewhere it's called &quot;dim sum&quot;.
Further data points are welcome.</dd>

<p>[1] For non-Australians who doubt me: quickly name as many of the states
and/or capitals of Australia as you can. See what I mean?</p>
<p>[2] The inventor of Esperanto.</p>
