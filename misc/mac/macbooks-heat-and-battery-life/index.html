      <p>As a recent purchaser of a MacBook (60G white), I've been very happy
with the machine. The performance is excellent, the physical form-factor
good, the price acceptable, the included devices (camera, IR port)
handy. There have been reports about the MacBook Pro line concerning
battery problems and over-heating <a class="reference external" href="macbook-heat.html#id4">[4]</a> , and some of these mentioned
similar issues on the MacBook <a class="reference external" href="macbook-heat.html#id6">[6]</a> <a class="reference external" href="macbook-heat.html#id5">[5]</a> . For the first two weeks, I
didn't encounter these. The machine was hot, no doubt, but it could be
sat on my lap without risk of burns. The battery life was excellent,
running about 4 hours depending on what the machine was doing.</p>
<p>Then, one night as I was using the MacBook, it suddenly ran out of
power. It had been fully charged less than 2 hours ago and used since
only for web-browsing and editing. Still, perhaps it had been
incorrectly plugged in. The next day, the same thing happened. And the
following day. I made sure the battery was fully charged up, unplugged
and checked the power item in the menu. Estimated remaining battery time
was 96%, 1 hour 50 minutes and falling. As I watched, in less than 5
minutes the remaining time decreased to 1 hour 30 minutes. The battery
appeared to be failing, but calling IOReg showed that the its amperage
and characteristics were at nominal or greater.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the MacBook started running a lot hotter. It was
uncomfortable to place on a lap for any period of time. The fan ran all
the time, regardless of what the machine was doing. Leaving the computer
plugged in and open (i.e. with the lid up) overnight, in the morning the
fan would still running. Only if the lid was closed, would the MacBook
cool down.</p>
<p>I did not initially connect these two phenomena. However, in studying
the heat problem the link became clear. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bresink.com/osx/TemperatureMonitor.html">Temperature Monitor</a> showed
that the two CPUs were running at 79-80C and the harddrive at 37C, even
when the computer was apparently doing nothing. The CPUs were working
all the time, so the fan was going all the time and so the battery was
runing down from driving the fan constantly.</p>
<p>But what was thrashing the CPUs? The machine was responsive enough. I
ran <em>top</em> to look for clues:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
1547 YahooWidgetEngine 160% 12:26:57 ...
</pre>
<p>160% of processor time?</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Widgets</a> gets something right that Apple's Dashboard doesn't.
Dashboard widgets exist in an application &quot;layer&quot; of their own, which
makes them more difficult to access or use. (Of what use is a compact
iTunes controller widget if you have to swap applications to get to it?
Why not just swap to iTunes?) In contrast, Yahoo Widgets lets you set
the layer the widget exists in -- the YW layer, floating on top of
everything else, etc. -- a far more useful interface. So I'd been using
it instead of Dashboard.</p>
<p>But Yahoo Widgets seemed to be churning the processors, albeit politely
since it didn't do it if other applications were demanding CPU time. I
quit the application, and then used kill -9 on YahooWidgetEngine process
as it appeared to keep running. Within minutes, the computer
temperatures were down to far more polite 52C (for the CPUs) and 30C
(for the harddrive). When fully charged, battery life returned to the 4
hour mark. Problem solved.</p>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Yahoo Widget Engine keeps the MacBook (and possibly
other machine models) CPUs running constantly, even when there is no
need. With the CPUs running all the time, temperatures rise, the fans
run non-stop, and battery life is shortened. No doubt there are other
causes of similar problems - this is just what was going on in my case.</p>
