      <p>This is not as straightforward as it seems.</p>
<p>In development, it works fine. Simply declare that the model has an
attachment:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class Download &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
        ...
        has_attached_file :attachment
</pre>
<p>and stuff will work automagically. A directory “system” will be created
in your public folder and the attachments will be created in there in a
nested fashion.</p>
<p>Your templates can give a link to file, for downloads etc, like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Download this file
&lt;a href=&quot;#{this.attachment}&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;       # in DRYML
&lt;%= link_to &quot;PDF&quot; , this.attachment.url %&gt;  # in Erb
</pre>
<p>'attachment' or 'attachment.url' seem to be synonyms, as far as passing
back an url that points to the physical file.</p>
<p>Stuff gets weird when you move beyond this simple case. For a start, if
you're serving from a suburl, you need to tell Paperclip about this. In
config/production.rb, do something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ENV[&quot;DOWNLOAD_ATTACHMENT_URL&quot;] =
        '/saird/system/:class/:attachment/:id/:basename.:extension'
</pre>
<p>That is, return an url that points into the public folder with the
appropriate path. The symbols in the string are interpolated, so you end
up with '/saird/system/mymodel/myattachment/foo.txt'.</p>
<p>Of course, this url has to use the appropriate set of directories /
symbols / path that Paperclip is using to store the file. Should you
need to change the location of those, or want to change the nested
hierarchy, you need to set the path explicitly. Again, in
config/production.rb:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ENV[&quot;DOWNLOAD_ATTACHMENT_PATH&quot;] =
':rails_root/public/system/:class/:attachment/:id/:basename.:extension'
</pre>
<p>And then the model details are modified:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
has_attached_file :attachment, :path =&gt;
        ENV.fetch('DOWNLOAD_ATTACHMENT_PATH', ':rails_root/public:url'),
        :url =&gt; ENV.fetch('DOWNLOAD_ATTACHMENT_URL',
        '/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename')
</pre>
<p>(Ignore the default details as being peculiar to my dev setup.)</p>
<p>So, what if you don't want the attachments to be stored in the public
directory? In the HPA case, we have two separate instances in different
locations serving off the same db. If they store files in public, the
two will become unsynchronised. Some files will be with one instance and
some with the other. So have them use a single central location, right?</p>
<p>Here's the rub: Paperclip doesn't really handle that. Paperclip wants to
assume that your stuff is in the public directory.</p>
<p>(This appears to be because they're all using Capistrano or some setup
where public/system is sym-linked to central file storage. So, the
problem has already been solved for them.)</p>
<p>So let's assume I've been given central storage at
”/home/saird”. I modify the path setting to be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ENV[&quot;DOWNLOAD_ATTACHMENT_PATH&quot;] =
        '/home/saird/system/:class/:attachment/:id/:basename.:extension'
</pre>
<p>But what's the url to that location? I naively assumed that Paperclip
was doing some clever routing (e.g. any requests that come in are mapped
to the actual filepath on the system). No. No, Paperclip just takes the
url and looks for the appropriate file in the public directory.</p>
<p>Right, so I put a symbolic link in the public folder that points at the
central storage:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% ln -s /home/saird public/storage
</pre>
<p>and set the url as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ENV[&quot;DOWNLOAD_ATTACHMENT_URL&quot;] =
        '/saird/storage/system/:class/:attachment/:id/:basename.:extension'
</pre>
<p>i.e. prefix it with the suburl appropriately and then route it through
the symbolic link to the central directory.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to use the symlink for the path setting as well,
but this resulted in a permissions error. This may be related to our
server setup however.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> another peculiar error resulted when the file storage was
given just as the directory in which it would be created, e.g.
'/home/saird', as some examples seemed to imply. Here it seemed
that Paperclip tried to copy the dir and corrupted all its permissions.
Charming.</p>
