      <p>The process of upgrading a Plone site can be intricate. The 2.0.x to
2.1.x jump is no different. (Anyone who has followed the series of
quirks and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.agapow.net/programming/python/plone-zope/yes-i-know">bugs</a>
in Agapow.net over the early part of 2006 will have seen the evidence.)
While you could just avoid the move, there are compelling new features
in the 2.1 release of Plone and several useful Products that work only
in 2.1.</p>
<p>Note: For reference, I was upgrading from Plone 2.0.5 and Zope 2.7.6,
and hoping to get to Plone 2.1.2 (the latest stable).</p>
<div class="section" id="general-notes">
<h2>General notes</h2>
<p>The first general principle is that Zope/Plone and their associated
Products can be very version-sensitive. So you can't just leap from say)
Zope 2.7 to 2.9. You may have to upgrade in several steps. Check the
requirements.</p>
<p>The second principle is that you upgrade from the top down. Update all
your products, then upgrade Plone, then Zope, then Python (if
necessary). Of course, updated versions of Products may lose
compatibility with older versions of Plone and so on (c.v.
RichDocument). Again, you may have to upgrade in several steps.</p>
<p>Third principle, backup all along the way. The simplest way is just to
copy the whole Products and var directories. This way, if you make a
mistake or are forced to rollback the upgrade, you can just drop the old
directories back and you're in business.</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.org/documentation/migration/2.1/">Plone migration
how-to</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specifics">
<h2>Specifics</h2>
<p>Specifics: First I upgraded Zope from 2.7.6 to 2.7.8. (Previous
experiments showed this was necessary.) Assuming you have several Zope
installations on your host machine, this is done by simply by changing
the paths listed in the the zope/bin/runzope and zope/bin/zopectl
scripts. Test your installation by running it with runzope -X
&quot;debug-mode=on and then shut it down.</p>
<p>Then I downloaded the latest version of Plone (2.1.2), unpacked and
copied - not moved! - all the resulting Products into your instance
Products directory. This makes it easier if you have to reattempt the
upgrade later. I tested the site with runzope again and it looked like a
mess but this is to be expected. There's a migration script to bring
content up to date, found in the ZMI in the site as the
portal_migration tool. It showed that the site instance was an older
version than that on disk, again what was expected. So I clicked Dry run
and attempted a migration.</p>
<p>Errors were reported and fixed before the migration was done for real.
Then I checked the Add/Remove products panel of the actual site to see
if anything needed to be updated or reinstalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assorted-issues">
<h2>Assorted issues</h2>
<p>Plone 2.1 makes all your top level folders tabs, one of the (IMHO)
uglier aspects of the Plone UI. The migration doc suggests a few ways to
get rid of, but I found it was easiest to just use a bit of css:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#portal-globalnav { display: none; }
</pre>
<p>Migration can get stymied by what appears to be incorrect or incomplete
folders, particularly the Members folder or those within it. If you
examine the traceback given at migration failure, you should see which
one is giving trouble. <a class="reference external" href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.plone.setup/255">Several scripts have been suggested to fix
this</a>
but I favoured a simpler solution: cutting all the content out of the
troublesome folder and then deleting it.</p>
<p>Another problem occurred with a top-level object I had with the id news.
The Plone migrator attempted to create a folder with the same id, and
fell over when it couldn't. Solution: rename the old folder, migrate,
and rename the new folder.</p>
<p>Making the jump to Zope2.9 will require more editting of the zope run
scripts, as the Python Zope module has been renamed to Zope2.</p>
<p>After the migration, PloneSoftwareCenter was broken, with any file
downloads from it silently failing. This can be fixed by installing the
most recent plone-2.1-integration branch of PSC from the Plone
collective SVN area, as well as the ExternalStorage product. This seems
to fix things.</p>
<p>CMFPhoto appears to be broken as well.</p>
