      <p>One of Plone's marked faults has been the lack of an out-of-the-box RSS
aggregation product. Although there have been a number of attempts
(CMFSin, CMFNewsFeed, CMFFeed), these are unfinished, quirky or only
semi-functional. Fortunately, PloneRSS is a robust solution for
gathering and publishing newsfeeds on your site. Unfortunately,
installation is not straightforward. These are some notes I gathered
from the last time I added PloneRSS to a site, to serve as an addenda to
the official instructions.</p>
<div class="section" id="step-1-obtain-plonerss">
<h2>Step 1: Obtain PloneRSS</h2>
<p>Unfortunately there are a number of stale links to this Product. The
previous location (together with some documentation) was at
<a class="reference external" href="http://encryptec.net/software/plonerss/">http://encryptec.net/software/plonerss/</a> but is no longer accessible. The
current link is at <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.org/products/plonerss">http://plone.org/products/plonerss</a>. There are
pointers back to documentation at the original site that no longer work.
<a class="reference external" href="http://encryptec.net/Members/gareth/product-update-plonerss">This</a> appears to be the limits of the current documentation, although
it points at an inaccessible project page. The product comes as a
bzipped archive. Strangely, several unarchiving programs (on both
Windows and Unix) failed to unpack the software correctly. This probably
a software or bzip fault, but keep trying until you get a folder
containing the PloneRSS product. Drop it into your sites 'Products'
directory. The latest version (0.9.3) does not seem to be compatible
with Plone 2.5, while the older 0.1build123 is.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-2-obtain-zmysqlda">
<h2>Step 2: Obtain ZMySQLDA</h2>
<p>Again, there are several rusty links and sites to this around the web.
The best appears to be at SourceForge. Don't worry that the adaptor was
last updated in 2001, it's quite functional. Download it and unpack it.
It comes as a hierachy of folders designed to unpack onto your Zope
installation (i.e. '/lib/python/Products/ZMySQLDA'). Find your Zope
installation (the binaries, not the site) and copy ZMySQLDA into the
'Products' folder in the Zope python library.</p>
<p>Restart your site to pick up the new software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3-create-the-database">
<h2>Step 3: Create the database</h2>
<p>Although PloneRSS comes with a SQL file that will create the database
for you if fed to MySQL, I've never managed to get this to work. (Note
that the file also has a different name to that in the instructions.)
It's simplest to open the folder and copy the SQL statements straight to
MySQL. You should end up with a database called 'plonerss' containg a
table 'feeds'.</p>
<p>Unmentioned in the PloneRSS instructons (perhaps because it's obvious),
you have to create a user with the appropriate privileges on the new
database:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
GRANT ALL ON plonerss.* TO plonerss_usr&#64;localhost
   IDENTIFIED BY 'pr_pass';
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-4-create-and-test-the-database-connection">
<h2>Step 4: Create and test the database connection</h2>
<p>Go into the ZMI of your site and in the 'custom' skins folder, create a
a ZMySQL Database Adaptor. Follow the instructions for giving a
configuration string but <em>database user password</em> (e.g. <em>plonerss
plonerss_user pr_pass</em>) should do. I had some difficulty getting it to
pick up my installation (probably a local error) and had to add the
socket location to get it to work:</p>
<blockquote>
plonerss plonerss_user plonerss_password /tmp/mysql.sock</blockquote>
<p>Note that is must be named as per the instructions
(PloneRSS_SQL_connection). Test the connection out from the ZMI, say
with the string SHOW DATABASES;. Install PloneRSS from the &quot;Install
products&quot; control panle of Plone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-5-add-the-portlet">
<h2>Step 5: Add the portlet</h2>
<p>In the ZMI, go to the properties of your site and add the PloneRSS
portlet to the right or left panel. If you have not installed PloneRSS,
you'll get a site error when next you visit the front page. The portlet
won't display until it has feeds available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-6-add-feeds">
<h2>Step 6: Add feeds</h2>
<p>PloneRSS adds three objects, and it can be unclear as to what they do.
The RSS Manager is essentially a control panel for your feeds, that
displays the health and status of your feeds. It may be content, but you
only need one per site and it serves as &quot;virtual folder&quot; where rss items
are displayed. Make one. RSS Feeds are the basic content that represents
(yes) a feed. Create a bunch of those. They won't start displaying until
they have been published. RSS Instance is basically an aggregator, that
gathers a group of selected feeds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assorted-issues">
<h2>Assorted issues</h2>
<p>After adding a certain feed, my RSS Manager refused to display due to a
character encoding problem. (Something in the new feeds url or
conetxet.) However it appears that the rest of the PloneRSS
infrastructure works without any problems, so this wasn't regarded as a
problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notes">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><em>Updated early 2008 with new information and links.</em></p>
<p><em>PloneRSS is largely superseded in Plone 3.x.</em></p>
