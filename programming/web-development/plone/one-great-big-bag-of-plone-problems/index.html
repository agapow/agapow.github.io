      <p>Whenever I get a cryptic error from Plone (which is all too frequently),
I google to see if anyone else has it. This is me paying back into the
system.</p>
<div class="section" id="can-t-add-type-nonetype-has-no-attribute-get">
<h2>Can't add type: 'NoneType has no attribute get'</h2>
<p>After fiddling with the schema on a type, adding it then failed, with
the informative traceback:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Traceback (innermost last): ... Module
Products.Amergin.content.phylogeny, line 6, in addPhylogeny Module
Products.BTreeFolder2.BTreeFolder2, line 446, in _setObject ... Module
Products.Archetypes.BaseContent, line 42, in manage_afterAdd ... Module
Products.ZCatalog.Catalog, line 277, in updateMetadata Module
Products.ZCatalog.Catalog, line 417, in recordify Module
Products.Archetypes.ExtensibleMetadata, line 314, in CreationDate
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
</pre>
<p>There's a lot more of it, but you get the idea. Looking at the source
for the final error, you can see that the problem is that the new object
has no field 'creationdate' and crashes out at that point. It took quite
a while to find the answer but in my schema definition for the class I
had mistakenly cut out the required base schema for an archetypes
object:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
_phylogeny_schema = Schema (( ...
</pre>
<p>instead of:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
_phylogeny_schema = BaseSchema.copy() + Schema (( ...
</pre>
<p><strong>Moral:</strong> as forbidding as it is, looking at the source can be a great
help.</p>
<p><strong>Rant:</strong> there's two problem with errors in Plone (1) they're far too
easy to make and (2) they're far too cryptic. Ideally, Archetypes
shouldn't even provide the option of creating an schema that's illegal,
and the errors from such should have been caught earlier in the creation
machinery rather than later. ExtensibleMetadata is 700 lines long,
doesn't contain a single assert and only raises one exception.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-t-delete-object-because-it-is-locked">
<h2>Can't delete object because it is locked</h2>
<p>One of my Products creates a lot of content programatically (i.e.
without the user directly adding it). In the upgrade between 2.5 and
3.0, a strange thing started happening. Content created this way could
not be deleted, giving a message like the title. It was as if the object
hadn't properly left the portal factory, although it was being created
in the same way as many other bits of code. <em>But</em> if you edited and
saved the content, it was then &quot;deletable&quot;.</p>
<p>The solution was simple: commit a transaction. This saves and unlocks
the object:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import transaction transaction.commit()
</pre>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> There's some nice urls for reference <a class="reference external" href="http://plone.org/documentation/how-to/add-content-programmatically">Add content
programmatically</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/manipulating-plone-objects-programmatically">Manipulating Plone objects
programmatically</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.len.ro/work/cms/create-links-with-a-script">Create links with a
script</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rant:</strong> &quot;Professional Plone development&quot; has a single reference to
transactions in its index, which points to a single page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="abruptly-truncating-text">
<h2>Abruptly truncating text</h2>
<p><strong>Symptom:</strong> When making an addition to one of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.agapow.net/fdgfddfgfd/personal/infoglut-2">Infoglut</a>
pages, a scrap of text was cut and pasted out of another application
(specifically an album title from iTunes). When the page was saved, the
text appeared to be truncated around the point of insertion. Although
this initially seemed to be a restructured text error, when the page was
opened up for editing again, it was shown that the text was actually
terminated at that point. All data beyond had been lost.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The behaviour is surprising, but the cause not. When the
text was cut-and-pasted into a text editor, a stray invisible control
character could be see at the point of truncation. Fortunately, by going
back in the browser, I could fetch the original text from the cache,
excise the problem character and repeat the edit to the correct form. It
would seem likely that this wasn't iTunes fault, but due to whoever
originally edited the album name.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="form-misbehaviour">
<h2>Form misbehaviour</h2>
<p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Several products malfunctioned when their forms were
submitted. For example, when a user created a guestbook entry in
<em>EasyGuestBook</em>, at the stage where it should show a preview of the
submitted text, Plone threw an error saying:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
validateShowPreview contained an error
</pre>
<p>The control panel configlet for <em>qPloneComments</em> did a similar thing
whenever a setting was changed. The only conmmon factor between these
two seemed to be that they both used <em>CMFFormController</em>. No traceback
was produced and both Products had previously been working fine.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> it seems that the problem is to do with linefeeds. Both
crashing scripts had DOS (CRLF) line-endings. How they got converted in
unclear but presumably something in <em>CMFFormController</em> requires either
native or Unix linefeeds. This is easily fixed by going to the skin
directory and converting everything to Unix with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
dos2unix -d -o *
</pre>
<p>or similar. <strong>Caveat:</strong> this assumes you are using a Unix system, of
course. If you're not, that's your problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pytz">
<h2>pytz</h2>
<p><strong>Symptom:</strong> You know how it is. You want to try out some new Products
or some cool stuff in a new version of Zope or Plone. So you install the
latest Zope binaries, instatiate a site, start it up just to test it and
get a freaky error message deep inside the timezone information that it
doesn't understand the way you are calling timezones. Sure, happens all
the time ...</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I got around this mysterious bug by just hacking the call
to the timezone module pytz. But belatedly there is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mechanicalcat.net/richard/log/Python/Interesting_egg_related_problem">an
explanation</a>
and it doesn't involve Zope. Briefly, when matplotlib is installed, it
also installs an old version of pytz. This can be cured by manually
updating pytz in your distribution or in MPL. Let the user beware.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-valid-images-that-aren-t">
<h2>The valid images that aren't</h2>
<p><strong>Symptom:</strong> I was passed some artwork (in the form of JPEGs exported
from Photoshop) to put up on a site. But if they were uploaded as an
image, they didn't appear within the content type. They still appeared
as the attached image under the edit tab, but couldn't be seen. They
didn't even appear as a broken image icon. They could be uploaded
straight to the ZMI, but again the content was present but the image
wasn't visble. Loading as a skin element of a product produced similar
results. The images appeared normal in Window's Image Viewer and OSX's
Prefix and Graphics Converter. Resaving the images, or renaming,
produced no chnage.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Comparing images that worked with those that didn't
produced a clue. The problematic images had a CMYK color profile as well
as some additional embedded fields. Saving the images wihtout this
profile imnformation fixed the problem. Presumably the Python Imaging
Library or Zope's internal image-handling code isn't savvy to part of
this additional profile data.</p>
