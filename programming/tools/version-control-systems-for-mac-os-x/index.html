		<div class="summary">Some quick notes from my search for decent source code control.</div>


      <p>This document was originally written in late 2003 / early 2004. The
scene has changed some in the meanwhile, with various offshoots of Arch
and Subversion gaining a lot of mindshare, and some of the URLs are
probably now invalid. However, the broad conclusions still hold, and
this is left here for informative value.</p>
<p>In the world of the amateur programmer (and often that of the scientific
programmer), version control systems / revision control / source code
management are usually neglected or left in the &quot;we'll do that sometime&quot;
basket. The arguments for using some form of code control have been
expounded upon at length by wiser heads than my own. So I'll just say
this:</p>
<blockquote>
Use some form of source code management. Even if it's just saving a
copy of your development folder weekly. Eventually, there <em>will</em> be
a disaster and you <em>will</em> need that backup.</blockquote>
<p>With the advent of OS X, a whole bunch of VCS tools have made their way
to the Macintosh. Below are a few very brief notes on the systems that
I've tried, put here for the general use. Some other resources on this
topic are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.electricfish.com/hawkfish/macvcs/">Macintosh Version Control</a>: a survey of available systems by someone who should know (a VCS developer), that is far more detailed than these notes. My only complaint is that it tends to concentrate on the graphical systems and doesn't mention some of the newer commandline tools (Bitkeeper, Arx etc.)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.14/14.06/VersionControlAndTheDeveloper/">Version Control and the Single Developer</a>: an older article by the same author as above, but chattier about the whole subject of version control.</li>

</ul>
<div class="section" id="cvs-concurrent-versions-system">
<h2>CVS (Concurrent Versions System)</h2>
<p>The defacto standard for version control, CVS has near-universal use in
the Unix world. It's been ported to just about everywhere, and exists in
commandline and graphical versions, with many associated tools. It's
free and has been used for massive projects. Project Builder interfaces
directly with CVS.</p>
<p>Having said that, I can't recommend using it. The whole system badly
needs overhauling, it doesn't do atomic transactions or cope well with
binary files. [unadorned opinion] I find CVS archaic, restrictive and
frustratingly opaque. [/unadorned opinion]</p>
<ul class="simple">

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="perforce">
<h2>Perforce</h2>
<p>Perforce is a commercial product but there is a free two-user demo for
non-commercial developers. That last restriction has prevented me from a
more than cursory examination of the product, but Perforce has lots of
fans, is cross platform, has commandline and web interfaces, is fast and
safe.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bitkeeper">
<h2>Bitkeeper</h2>
<p>This has won a lot of fans but if you google for opinions on Bitkeeper,
you'll end up with a lot of pages ranting on about how the Linux kernel
development team shouldn't be using it, due to some admittedly strange
licensing terms. [deep sigh] Still, if it's good enough for the Linux
people, it's probably worth checking out. It's available for free with
some minor restrictions and has a lot of nice features.</p>
<p>The Mac OS X download for Bitkeeper comes as a .bin file that no
dearchiving software wants to know about. Go to the commandline, change
the name of the file and make it executable before running it. You also
have to explicitly say where you want the executable installed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
downloads&gt; mv bk-301-macosx-ppc.bin bk
downloads&gt; chmod +x bk
downloads&gt; ./bk [... installation ensues ...]
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">Bitkeeper</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voodoo">
<h2>VOODOO</h2>
<p>VOODOO is a well crafted, award-winning, commercial, GUI tool available
in standalone and server versions, but only on the Macintosh. I ponied
up the price for this a few years ago and used it for 6 months before
moving on. It is a very good and robust product and undoubtably a lot of
people will find it's just what they need. But ...</p>
<p>... but I found it a bit too powerful and overwhelming for my own needs.
The Mac-only aspect was a bit of a problem and I tangled repeatedly with
the CodeWarrior plugin. You can set up CodeWarrior so that when you open
a project, it checks all the necessary files out from VOODOO. However,
you have to explicitly check them back in. Which means that if you close
the project without checking the files back in or have a crash [you can
see this coming, right?] ... when you next open the project, VOODOO
overwrites all the files you changed. Whimper.</p>

<div class="section" id="subversion">
<h2>Subversion</h2>
<p>Subversion is an ambitious project aimed at correcting all the perceived
problems with CVS and building a fully. Despite it's seemingly
perpetually low version number, it is quite functional and has a lot of
fans. It has a converter for CVS repositories, is designed to work over
the Internet</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to set up or host a Subversion repository, you have to
setup your Apache webserver. As far as I'm concerned, setting up
webservers is one of those TTIPOPTD (Things I Pay Other People To Do).
Tom Lord (who designed Arch) has also expressed severe reservations
about the direction of the Subversion project. This was therefore a
no-go.</p>
<p>(A posting on Slashdot asserted that you didn't need Apache to run
Subversion. My reading of the FAQ said otherwise and if I was wrong, so
much the better.)</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="arch-arx-etc">
<h2>Arch , ArX etc.</h2>
<p>Arch is a simple, light-weight VCS that's easy to learn and features
distributed repositories and easy branching. It's what I've settled on
for the moment as it seemed to be just powerful enough for my needs and
no more. It's got a lot of complimentry press. At some point Arch forked
and spawned another version, ArX, although there's little to pick
between the two versions to my eye. There are also a number of more
offbeat implementations.</p>
<p>Written in some bizarre concoction of languages, against all
expectations Arch works. One must pay close attention to the
installation instructions however, for they must be followed to the
letter otherwise strange errors messages are eventually produced.
(Eventually - otherwise it would be easy to know what's gone wrong.)
Even then, the test suite generates some errors. Despite these, it will
install and run nicely. Just for reference, the steps I used for
ArX-1.0pre7 are below. However, the accompanying documentation should
always take precedence:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% cd ArX-1.0pre7
% cd src
% mkdir =build
% cd =build
% ../configure --prefix ~/bin/ [...]
% make CFLAGS=-no-cpp-precomp CXX=c++ % make [...]
% make test [...]
% make install [...]
</pre>
