		<div class="summary">Overcoming the sometimes tricky installation of the Python Imaging Library and improving image quality.</div>


      <p>While some people have reporting installing
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a> on MacOSX without
problems, there are legion reports that say otherwise. Frequently this
revolve around PIL installing without JPEG support. There are a myriad
of solutions (involving editing make files, configure flags, using fink
to install dependencies, using package managers, casting goat entrails,
etcetera, etcetera ...), all of which I tried and had no joy with. The
solution that finally worked was to grab the libjpeg package from
<a class="reference external" href="http://macosx.forked.net/showcat.php?cat=Libraries&amp;sortmethod=reverse">here</a>
and install that. Afterwards the PIL install proceded without problems
and tested fine.</p>
<p>While the image manipulations within the library are impressive, in some
case the resultant image quality isn't quite good enough. To see one
problem, create an image with a series of lines radiating out at various
angles. Some of the lines will come out quite jagged and &quot;pixelly&quot;. Text
also shows some of these defects. One solution is to draw your picture
at a much larger size, and then shrink it down using the anti-alias
filter.</p>
<p>Another - and better - way is to use the
<a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/zone/pythondoc-aggdraw.htm">aggdraw</a> library for
drawing PIL images. It uses internally the <em>antigrain geometry</em> library
for high quality anti-aliased images. (In plain langauge - it produces
slight fuzzy but smoother images.) One catch is that for drawing text,
<em>aggdraw</em> uses the <em>freetype</em> text library. If you're on Windows, you're
in luck - <em>aggdraw</em> installer includes <em>freetype</em>. If you're on a Unix
system, you have to download and install freetype yourself. Follow the
instructions, make sure you're installing freetype v2 not v1 and you
shouldn't have anyproblems. What may trip you up is getting <em>aggdraw</em> to
recognise that freetype is installed and where. In the setup.py file of
your aggdraw distribution, you'll find a line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
FREETYPE_ROOT = &quot;../../kits/freetype2011preblahblah&quot;
</pre>
<p>The instructions say to edit this as necessary, but it's not clear to
what. In fact, <em>FREETYPE_ROOT</em> should point at the folder that holds
the include directory that holds the freetype2 folder. On most system
this will be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
FREETYPE_ROOT = &quot;/usr/local&quot;
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, if you try and install <em>aggdraw</em> before installing
<em>freetype</em>, it seems to have trouble later recognising if the freetype
library has appeared. (At least I did.) Presumably the setup caches some
results or code from the first time it is is run, that never get
updated. The easiest solution is just to unpack and use a fresh copy of
<em>aggdraw</em>.</p>
<p>So you should install <em>freetype</em> to use <em>aggdraw</em> to use <em>PIL</em>. Simple.</p>

<h2>Addendum July 2007</h2>
<p>More installs of PIL, more surprises. This time my extensive install
notes failed me in new and curious ways. While the <a class="reference external" href="http://darwinports.com/">Darwin
ports</a> installer has been useful in the
past, this time it created a seemingly correct but non-functional copy
of freetype. PIL would then bomb out during the compile. trying to
install PIL via port ended up installing a whole new copy of Python.</p>
<p>Eventually, the instructions on the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/MacPython/UniversalLibrariesAndExtensions">Python
wiki</a>
on how to compile and PIL (via compiling and installing freetype and
libjpeg) proved to work. Some notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You may need to delete to remove any dysfunctional freetype, libjpeg etc before following the wiki install, or else PIL might keep finding the bad libraries.</li>
<li>Some of the lines they have you delete in various make files don't appear exactly like they do in the notes, but it works anyway.</li>
<li>Finally, the install set of PIL may complain about a missing directory for man files - you can either ignore this or create the directories yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>As regards aggdraw, <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/">PythonMac</a> now
has pre-compiled packages for it, which is a huge time saver.</p>

<p>Y'know, maybe you should just use <a class="reference external" href="https://pillow.readthedocs.org/">Pillow</a> instead, a 'friendly' re-implementation of PIL.</p>
