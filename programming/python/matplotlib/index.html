      <p><a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.sf.net">Matplotlib</a> is cool. Did I say it was
cool? I meant very cool. While principally a plotting library, it can be
used for image manipulation and drawing.</p>
<div class="section" id="draw-lines">
<h2>draw_lines</h2>
<p>Which is where our first problem occurs (as of the 0.8.4 version of
matplotlib and possibly earlier). Should you try and use the Agg backend
to draw a few lines on a picture like so:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import RendererAgg
from matplotlib.transforms import Value

dpi = Value (72.0)
theIm = RendererAgg (400, 400, dpi)
theGc = theIm.new_gc()
theIm.draw_lines (theGc, (50 , 100 ), (150 , 200))
</pre>
<p>matplotlib will choke with the message:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
IndexError: Unexpected SeqBase&lt;T&gt; length
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">draw_lines</tt> does more or less the same thing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
theIm.draw_lines (theGc, (10, 20, 30), (50, 60, 70))
</pre>
<p>The problem appears to be that <tt class="docutils literal">draw_lines</tt> can be called with an
optional argument to transform the line(s). If this is not passed, an
assertion is triggered just at the start of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RendererAgg::draw_lines</span></tt> within
<tt class="docutils literal">_backend_agg.cpp</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
args.verify_length(4);
</pre>
<p>as there are only 3 arguments. <tt class="docutils literal">draw_line</tt> runs into problems because it
is implemented as a call to <tt class="docutils literal">draw_lines</tt>. Although the transfrom argument
is supposed to be set to <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> by default, this doesn't help because
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RendererAgg::draw_lines</span></tt> trys to access the <tt class="docutils literal">ptr()</tt> argument of the
transform. (In fact, it's worse as this has a tendency to kill the
python interpreter.)</p>
<p>This problem can be solved from the user level by calling <tt class="docutils literal">draw_lines</tt>
with the identity transform (and where needed using <tt class="docutils literal">draw_lines</tt> to draw
a single line):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from matplotlib.transforms import identity_transform
identity_trans = identity_transform()
theIm.draw_lines (theGc, (50 , 100), (150 , 200), identity_trans)
</pre>
<p>This has been <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1353312&amp;group_id=80706&amp;atid=560720">lodged as a
bug</a>.
A followup to my report acknowledges the problem, saying it's the result
of transition between old and new drawing APIs. In this light, my above
solution seems reasonable.</p>

<h2>More installation woes</h2>
<p>In mid-2006, after getting a new MacBook, I spent three days trying to
install matplotlib. It wasn't just one problem but a series of different
issues that disguised each other. Thanks to the members of the
matplotlib mailing list for helping me sort it out. (The technical
parameters were, at the beginning: OSX 10.4, MPL 0.87.4, with <tt class="docutils literal">numeric</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">numarray</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">numpy</tt> installed.)</p>
<p>The problems all surrounded the use of <tt class="docutils literal">pylab</tt>. Matplotlib would install
and import fine:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import matplotlib
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>but when pylab was invoked, implicitly or explicitly, it would fail with
a delightful variety of error messages. The first was:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pylab
[...] matrix undefined
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem occured on line 74 of <tt class="docutils literal">matplotlib/numerix/__init__.py</tt>
where <tt class="docutils literal">Matrix = matrix</tt>. matrix should have been defined when numpy was
imported as the numerical library for MPL in the same file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import numpy.oldnumeric as numpy
from numpy.oldnumeric import *
</pre>
<p>However, oldnumeric doesn't define a term matrix. Setting MPL to use
Numeric instead of Numpy, this step is passed but I run into the next
error, also at the import pylab stage:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Debug: ../src/common/object.cpp(224): assert
&quot;sm_classTable-&gt;Get(m_className) == NULL&quot; failed: class already in
RTTI table - have you used IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_CLASS() twice (may be
by linking some object module(s) twice)?
../src/common/object.cpp(224): assert
&quot;sm_classTable-&gt;Get(m_className) == NULL&quot; failed: class already in
RTTI table - have you used IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_CLASS() twice (may be
by linking some object module(s) twice)?
</pre>
<p>The first error is the result of an incompatibility between matplotlib
0.87.4 and numpy 1.0b and higher. The solution is to install matplotlib
0.87.5.</p>
<p>The second problem is caused by something entirely different. If you
grep for sm_classTable in the MPL source, you'll find it in the wxagg
sources. In fact, the problem turned out be with wxPython. MPL either
couldn't find my wxPython installation or was finding the wrong. The
environmental variable WX_CONFIG has to be set to the path of the
wx-config executable for the correct installation. Once that is is done,
MPL installs with fewer error messages (see below) and pylab imports and
runs perfectly.</p>
<p>Another problem that occurred during this: MPL also requires <tt class="docutils literal">freetype2</tt>,
not <tt class="docutils literal">freetype</tt> (1). Freetype seems to get installed by every second
program and so there were multiple installations on my disk. In
addition, freetype2 compilation is easy to screw up in the Mac / ppc /
intel universe. If matplotlib / pylab finds the wrong or a bad freetype2
installation, you may get a lot of warnings or errors about legacy calls
to <tt class="docutils literal">_FontFamilyIterator</tt> etc. While it is probably possible to get the
source compiled correctly using the right arguments to ./configure, in
the end it proved easiest to get the library from
<a class="reference external" href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">Darwinports</a>.</p>
<p>(As an aside, if you install Darwinports and then upgrade your home
system Tcl/Tk, this may hose some Tcl packages required by port. See
what a fun week I've had?)</p>
<p>As a further aside when matplotlib is built, a bunch of ominous but
non-fatal warnings are generated like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/usr/bin/ld: for architecture ppc /usr/bin/ld: warning fat file:
/usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.10.4.dylib does not contain an architecture
that matches the specified -arch flag: ppc (file ignored)
</pre>
<p>when linking various agg and _nc_transforms pieces, as well as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
src/_ns_backend_agg.cpp:41:1: warning: &quot;M_PI&quot; redefined
In file included from /usr/include/math.h:26, from
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.0.0/cmath
</pre>
<p>These appear to be spurious or at least don't interfere with the
function of MPL.</p>
<p>Finally, it would do well to check what version of Xcode and DevTools
you have. Despite having a brand new Mac, the version of XCode that came
with it was significantly out of date, and may of had issues recognising
the Intel architecture.</p>
