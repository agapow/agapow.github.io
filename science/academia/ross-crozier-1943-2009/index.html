      <p>The sudden death of Ross Crozier on the 12th of November was heralded
largely by a slow ripple of email, phone calls and Facebook messages
across the globe.  I found out from an email that started with a short
but singularly complete sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Terrible news.</em></blockquote>
<p>It is sobering to think that I knew Ross for nearly 20 years, first as
a superannuated and vaguely disreputable PhD candidate and then after
graduation as a regular collaborator. It is difficult to think of a time
before Ross, before his invaluable mentorship, advice and tutelage. It
is difficult to think of a time after.</p>
<p>Others have listed Ross' accomplishments and awards, his many
contributions across science, in conservation biology, evolutionary
genetics and sociobiology. But to focus only on conventional landmarks
of a successful academic career would be a mistake. Ross' life is most
keenly seen in the countless students, junior scientists and colleagues
that he taught, coached and befriended.</p>
<p>He was never more at home then when surrounded by young students and
postdocs, excitedly talking about their research and science. Rather
than hold court, he acted more as a ringleader or co-conspirator,
allowing even the least experienced or knowledgeable to have a word or
play their part. If you made a particularly careless mistake or said
something stupid - too often in my case - he might just raise his
eyebrows and say &quot;Hmm. Well.&quot;, a phrase that only in retrospect
translated as <em>I think you might want to examine your theory there</em>.
When the inevitable and demoralising failures occurred - overly-critical
reviews of papers, unsuccessful job applications, unfunded grants - he
would counsel resting for a few days to lick our wounds before returning
to the fray. When the victories came, he joined you in celebrating.</p>
<p>His knowledge was voluminous. When when starting a new project, rather
than doing the background research it was often easier to ask Ross what
he knew. I recall passing an early draft of my thesis before him. After
a single glance, he advised that a reference was probably incorrect. <em>I
think it was published in 1981 not 1982. And the authors initial was E,
not F. You should look at that.</em> He professed a love for classic
science fiction (Asimov and Heinlein, I pointed him in the direction of
William Gibson and Greg Egan without any luck) and a late rediscovery of
Johnny Cash and country music. But Ross's main pastime was science and
emails would arrive from him that were written on a Sunday morning or
late on a weekend night. <em>I've just had a thought ...</em></p>
<p>Despite his passion, his demeanour was not that of the obsessive. Owner
of a relentlessly even temper, he leavened it with a dry and playful
humour.  His move from urban Melbourne to the tropical and provincial
James Cook University spurred more dry commentary, with me a supposedly
sympathetic respondent as an ex-Queenslander. One email discussing a
paper in progress ended: <em>Help, our couch is growing fungus!  * Another
time, he mused, &quot;When we moved up here, people warned us that everything
shuts at 7.30, you can't buy *The Australian</em>, and nobody wears black.
Well, that's untrue. The paper shop at the airport stocks <em>The
Australian</em>.&quot; Once, he attended an open day for prospective
undergraduates. One eager - and perhaps confused - candidate buttonholed
Ross and told him how she has gotten interested in biology through
&quot;watching <em>The X-Files</em>&quot;. Ross was polite but curious, returning home to
search for and watch a random episode of the show. The next day he
ranted about &quot;this worm-man creature created by radiation, that
slithered out of pipes and infected people by biting them&quot; before
throwing up his hands up in perplexed delight.</p>
<p>Ross took a chance when he took me on as a student. He stood by by me
when no others would He borne my complaints and anxieties with equamity.
By my reckoning, one of the last things he must have done was write a
job reference for me. We met in person for the last time last year in
Bonn. Always the prototypical nerdy entomology-wonk, he stood out among
the sharply dressed European scientists in suits, wearing an old
short-sleeved workshirt with too many pens stuffed in the pocket. When
he saw me, his face split into a wide grin as he grabbed for and shook
my hand in joy. I owe him. I am one of many.</p>
<p>66 years is old and arguably elderly, but Ross' behaviour and energy
was neither. It was a rare week that was without at least one email from
Ross. Often I would find 2, 3 or even 4 emails from him, each adding
another thought or idea. At the time of his death, we had two papers in
progress together. And I was just one of many, one of the far-flung web
of collaborators that he kept up a steady conversation with, a steady
pulse of research. I fear this lead me and others into the silent
assumption that there would always be more, always more ideas, more
incisive critiques, more advice. We owe, I owe, and it was my delusion
there would be more time in which to repay, at least in some small part,
the great debt I owe him.</p>
<p>I walk within his shadow. I always will.</p>
