      <div class="section" id="xeno-s-paradox-of-manuscript-completeness">
<h2>Xeno's paradox of manuscript completeness</h2>
<p>No matter how many drafts you go through, the number of helpful
suggestions make by your co-authors will approach but never quite reach
zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plato-s-allegory-of-collaborators-and-the-cave-wall">
<h2>Plato's allegory of collaborators and the cave wall</h2>
<p>Distinguished or influential co-authors have a tendency to invite,
introduce or insist upon the addition of other co-authors, typically
their staff, old lab-mates or senior scientists they are hoping to
impress. Our circumstances are such that we are unable to directly
observe the actual contribution of these co-authors, but only see it
indirectly, like shadows cast on a cave wall. Or more accurately, as an
entries on the authorship byline.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sapir-whorf-complaint-hypothesis">
<h2>Sapir-Whorf complaint hypothesis</h2>
<p>Linguistic relativity holds that language affects the ways in which its
speakers conceptualize their world, implying there is no guarantee that
two individuals can communicate certain concepts. This why you will
occasionally encounter a co-author who will repeatedly say they are
&quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;unhappy&quot; with a manuscript, but be unable to
articulate what gives rise to this objection or how to correct it. Often
they will only be able to say that &quot;It should be fixed&quot;, without saying
what &quot;it&quot; or the &quot;fix&quot; is.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relativity-and-the-twin-paradox">
<h2>Relativity and the twin paradox</h2>
<p>In this thought experiment, there are two identical twins, one stays on
Earth while the other makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket.
You ask both for comments on a manuscript &quot;by the end of the week&quot;. The
one on Earth sends you their comments within the week, while the second
sends you their comments two months later, on a now out-dated version of
the manuscript. Clearly the second has experienced time-dilation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="searle-s-chinese-room">
<h2>Searle's Chinese Room</h2>
<p>A thought experiment which asks whether it is possible to distinguish an
intelligent, well-written broad review from one that is randomly packed
full of references to a Talmudic melange of subjects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="revision-orbits-and-attractors">
<h2>Revision orbits and attractors</h2>
<p>Certain complex systems settle into stable dynamics where they oscillate
through a repeating set of states. This is why the first reviews of your
manuscript will ask for a section to be deleted, the second set of
reviews will lament the absence of the same section and the third set
will label it unnecessary. Regrettably, journal editors are apparently
unschooled in chaos mathematics and refuse to acknowledge this
phenomena.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parable-of-the-blind-men-and-the-elephant">
<h2>Parable of the blind men and the elephant</h2>
<p>In this tale, a group of blind men touch an elephant to learn what it is
like. Each one feels a different part, such as the leg or the tusk,
compares notes and learns that they are in complete disagreement as to
what they have encountered. Similarly, teams of co-authors sometimes
exist in a state where it is unclear what manuscript they are writing or
commenting on, even seeming to disagree what the point of the paper is
and the findings are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="revising-brain-in-a-vat">
<h2>Revising brain in a vat</h2>
<p>In this philosophical experiment, a naked brain in placed in a vat of
life-sustaining fluids and wired up such that it receives the same
impulses it would as if it were in a body walking around. The question
therefore is whether a brain - merely from the evidence of its own
sense - can tell whether it is actually in a body or a vat. After 8 hours
sitting in front of a computer, refreshing Mendeley, trying to decipher
referee's comments and failing to get to the gym for the 3rd time this
week, the distinction may be moot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lifeboat-ethics">
<h2>Lifeboat ethics</h2>
<p>In this metaphor for resource distribution, a group of co-authors are
gathered on a lifeboat at ocean surrounded by hundreds of potential
collaborators. The central dilemma is whether to invite other people
on-board, at the risk of over-loading the boat.</p>
<p>Most solutions involve ejecting the data analysts and technicians from
the boat, while exhorting the lone grad student at the oars to &quot;row
faster&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="schrodinger-s-citation">
<h2>Schrodinger's citation</h2>
<p>Consider a journal submission system as a black box. It cannot be opened
or examined in anyway. A manuscript is submitted into the black box.
What happens inside the box is unclear but in time a response is
emitted, listing many changes that are needed, including requests to
include seemingly irrelevant work (&quot;gene conversion in salamanders&quot;),
calls to cite vaguely described papers which may or may not exist
(&quot;Dubois's work that was in PNAS or PLoS six or eight years ago&quot;), or
the need to compare your work against an arbitrary other study (&quot;how do
your findings on plastid co-evolution reflect on distemper in
muntjacs?&quot;). At this point you wonder what could possibly be going on at
the journal or in the referee's head.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lady-or-the-tiger">
<h2>Lady or the Tiger</h2>
<p>You are presented with two indistinguishable doors. Behind one is a lady
who will accept your manuscript graciously, offer erudite comments,
correct misspellings and then publish it. Behind the other is a tiger.
It devour you and then criticise your choice of controls. You must
choose a door. Which one do you pick?</p>
<p>Note: experience says that no matter what your strategy, you will always
end up picking the tiger. Better justify those controls better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trolley-problem-of-stating-results">
<h2>Trolley problem of stating results</h2>
<p>Envisage your manuscript as a trolley-car headed down a set of tracks
towards publication. Looking ahead, you notice that your findings will
run into several other researchers (highlight the limitations of their
approach and invalidating their results). Your co-author points out that
by switching tracks (omitting some discussion, inventing a caveat and
focusing on an improbable explanation), you will instead collide with
the work of a different but lone researcher. What should you do?</p>
<p>Answer: who is likely to be on your next interview committee?</p>
