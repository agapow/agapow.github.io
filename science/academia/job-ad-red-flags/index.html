      <dl class="docutils">
<dt>&quot;competitive salary&quot;:</dt>
<dd>Like several other terms on this list, this phrase is can be used in a completely sincere manner: <em>We pay decently. If we offer you the job, then we'll negotiate.</em> Unfortunately, it is just as frequently used as a way of avoiding the subject of remuneration, in the hope that by the time you learn the unfortunate truth, you'll give in due to sunk time and effort.</dd>
<dt>&quot;prestigious&quot;:</dt>
<dd>An institution or award that feels the need to tell you that it's famous and well-regarded, usually isn't.</dd>
<dt>&quot;salary band&quot;:</dt>
<dd>Encountered in the job search process at the beginning and the end with different meanings. At the beginning it appears in the job ad as &quot;salary band for the successful applicant will be $X to $Y&quot;. At the end it appears in the offer letter &quot;it is our policy to appoint at the bottom of the salary band&quot;.</dd>
<dt>&quot;passion&quot;:</dt>
<dd>We pay poorly and expect you to work long hours.</dd>
<dt>&quot;manager&quot;:</dt>
<dd>If the word &quot;manager&quot; is used in any context other than actually managing people, it's just a blatant way of puffing up an menial infrastructure job. (A recruiter actually once confessed this to me.) &quot;Director&quot; is beginning to assume the same meaning.</dd>
<dt>&quot;starting pay is low but ...&quot;</dt>
<dd>Your pay will be low.</dd>
<dt>&quot;... there's plenty of scope for advancement, the sky's the limit&quot;</dt>
<dd>Your pay will be low.</dd>
<dt>&quot;critical duties&quot;:</dt>
<dd>This is a great litmus test of whether the employer has a realistic attitude to what can be done. I once came across a job description that listed 72 &quot;key responsibilities&quot;, which is 29 minutes per responsibility per week. And remember - the listed duties are just the start. There will always be more, always things that were forgotten or get added later.</dd>
<dt>&quot;essential skills&quot;:</dt>
<dd>Much like <em>critical duties</em>, this is a good test of realism. If the job ad is asking for &quot;substantial experience in bioinformatics support&quot; <em>and</em> &quot;10 years in Java 2EE development&quot; <em>and</em> &quot;a record of publication in top journals&quot;, you may rightly expect that the employer is thinking of several different people.</dd>
<dt>&quot;10% of your time will be devoted to ...&quot;:</dt>
<dd>At least 10% (and probably much more) of your time will be devoted to ...</dd>
<dt>&quot;Send in 3 copies of your application&quot;:</dt>
<dd>What is this - the 1970s?</dd>
<dt>&quot;Must be able to perform under pressure&quot;:</dt>
<dd>We're going subject you to an undifferentiated torrent of demands, stress and chaos.</dd>
<dt>&quot;Must be flexible / dynamic role&quot;:</dt>
<dd>There's no job description. Alternatively, if we told you what the job actually entails, you'd never apply.</dd>
<dt>&quot;lively social club&quot;:</dt>
<dd>The work site is in the middle of nowhere.</dd>
