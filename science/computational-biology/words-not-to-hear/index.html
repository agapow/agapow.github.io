<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“The data is all in these [proprietary and undocumented format] files.”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“What I want is a program to browse, edit and validate gigabyte-size whole genome sequencing runs. It should import and export all known formats. And it has to run in a browser. And some of our staff refuse to use anything but IE6.”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><em>(After delivering an insignificant or negative result)</em> “Can’t you analyse it again?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“Why don’t we put the new server rack in your office?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“That software you wrote is buggy!</p>
<p>[What happened?]</p>
<p>It’s not working!</p>
<p>[How do you know that?]</p>
<p>It’s broken!</p>
<p>[In what way?]</p>
<p>Can’t you just fix it?</p>
<p>[How? I don't know what's wrong ...]</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“I don’t understand - [large research institute / multinational commercial company] has software that can do this. Can’t you just write something similar?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“This is a great / exciting opportunity …”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“This program is great. But could you rewrite it in another programming language?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“That database and web service you wrote for X? We need one that works just like that. Except for …&quot;
[lists dozens of ways in which the new service actually differs entirely from the previous one]</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“You want to know what feature or task is the most important? They all are!”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><em>(After being told that the data sample is too small, or incorrectly sampled such that analysis is impossible.)</em></p>
<p>“You don’t understand – we really need this result.”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“Here’s the data. I haven’t had time to clean it up, so it might be incomplete. And some of the identifiers might not agree. And there are mis-spellings …”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><em>(After delivering the outcome of an analysis)</em> “Pth – that result is obvious.”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“Don’t worry about who’s going to [maintain the new database / monitor the new service / curate the data / come in on the weekends to restart the system]. We’ll work that out later …”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“So X wrote us this pipeline before he left. I’m not sure if he finished it. No, there’s no documentation. Can you get it working? By next week?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“I think I read a way to do this: it was in a journal, maybe. Or on a webpage. Done by some lab in France. Or was it China? Anyway, it should be simple.”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“Do you really need that much disk space for this NGS data?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“So your program crashed when I tried to load data. What format? Does that matter? They were Word documents. Really, the program doesn’t read those?”</p>
<p>“So, what you’re saying is that a Word document isn’t a text file. But I used Courier as a font.”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“We need this program. It’s really simple … [30 minutes of essential features follow]“</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>&quot;I'm sure it can't be that complicated ...&quot;</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><em>(While waiting for the result of a Bayesian calculation)</em></p>
<p>“Why does it take so long to get this answer? Can’t you just make it go faster?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“I know you said that 30 data points were the minimum for statistical rigour. But we only got 5. Can’t you analyze it anyway?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“We keep all those records in Excel files … uh, I think this is the most current version …”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“The Z lab showed you could do this [with 10 genes and a computing cluster]. So do you think you could this this with our data [200 whole genomes, on a PC]?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“Good news – we got a huge grant for sequencing and annotating 6 squillion whole genomes. You’re not on the grant and we didn’t budget for any bioinformatic work but here’s the data. Can you have this done by next week?”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><em>(After being told that an analysis is impossible or ill-considered)</em> “But X over in Y’s lab does it all the time.”</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>“Uh, so what is it that you do again?”</p>
